# HTML starter instructions

Follow the `marimo-studio` skill for notebook ownership, projection selection,
view lifecycle, and validation. This file covers the browser-native project
supplied by this starter.

## Project intent

This view is an internal SSB editing tool for statistics producers working in
their normal production workflow.

Users run their statistics production programmatically, load fresh numbers into
their Parquedit tables, and then open this app to manually edit rows in the
selected Parquedit table.

### Primary user

The primary user is a statistics producer who needs to review and manually edit
data as part of statistics production.

### Core task

Help the user safely choose a Parquedit table, find the correct row or unit,
manually edit one or more values on that row, provide a required reason for the
change, optionally add a comment, and save the change back to the Parquedit
table.

### Workflow

The expected workflow is:

1. Select the Parquedit table to edit.
2. Use the table's search and filtering features to find the correct row.
3. Select a row before editing.
4. Review the editing form below the table.
5. Change one or more variables for the selected row.
6. Provide a required reason for the change.
7. Optionally provide a comment.
8. Save the changes.
9. Review edit history when needed.

### Product priorities

Prioritize these qualities above all else:

1. Safe editing
2. Low learning curve
3. Few user mistakes

### UX risks to avoid

The biggest usability risks are:

- The user does not understand that a row must be selected before editing.
- The user does not understand how to select a row.
- Wide tables with many columns become hard to scan and work with.
- The app feels clumsy or confusing, which reflects poorly on Dapla as a platform.

### What the user must understand immediately

When the view opens, make these points obvious:

- A row must be selected before editing can happen.
- The table supports finding the right row through rich table functionality.
- The editing form lives below the table and is used after row selection.

### Tone and writing style

Use a helpful tone. Prefer clear, calm, task-oriented Norwegian copy. Keep
instructions short and practical.

### Visual direction

The user should recognize this as an SSB app. Reuse SSB colors and icons so the
view feels familiar and aligned with SSB's visual identity.

Follow `DESIGN.md` in this project for SSB-specific layout, styling, and cell
design guidance.

### Design system guidance

Use DigDir as inspiration only. Reuse its interaction patterns and clarity when
helpful, but do not force strict DigDir component usage or heavy dependencies.

### Technical preferences

For this view:

- Desktop is the primary target.
- Mobile should still work, but desktop matters most.
- Avoid heavy frontend dependencies.
- Keep notebook logic in Python and view/layout logic in Studio source.
- Prefer modular notebook outputs that can be arranged cleanly in the Studio view.

### Column-heavy tables

Assume some Parquedit tables will contain many columns. Prioritize UI patterns
that let the user choose which columns are visible so the workflow stays
manageable.

## Use the supplied Studio integration

`index.html` starts with one `<marimo-cell>` host for each enabled notebook cell
that may display output, including literal Markdown. Keep, reorder, group, or
replace those hosts as the page design develops. Their generated names remain
stable Studio targets for the notebook cells.

The starter defines `observeMarimoValue` inside the `index.html` module script.
Keep it inline or move it to a JavaScript file referenced directly from the
entry document. Use it when page JavaScript consumes a notebook value or eager
dataframe. Keep the corresponding `mo-value` host in authored HTML so Studio
can inspect and authorize its selector.

```html
<span id="rows-data" hidden mo-value="rows"></span>
```

```js
const source = document.querySelector("#rows-data");
if (source) {
  const stop = observeMarimoValue(source, {
    onValue: (rows) => renderRows(rows),
    onError: (error) => renderError(error.message),
  });
  window.addEventListener("pagehide", stop, { once: true });
}
```

Eager dataframes arrive as a shared Flechette `Table`. Use
[https://github.com/uwdata/flechette](https://github.com/uwdata/flechette) as
the table API reference. Treat the table as immutable. Keep data columnar with
`getChild()`, `select()`, and `toColumns()`. Call `toArray()` when browser code
needs row objects.

## Add dependencies

Add a browser dependency by referencing its URL from `index.html`, with a
`<script src>` tag or an `import` statement in a module script. Studio publishes
the page as written, so the next build picks up the new URL.

`index.html` loads two pinned browser dependencies from jsDelivr:

- [UnoCSS runtime](https://unocss.dev/integrations/runtime) with its default
  Wind3 preset. Use utility classes directly in authored HTML. The
  runtime observes DOM changes and generates matching styles in the browser.
- [Iconify Icon web component](https://iconify.design/docs/iconify-icon/).
  Add named icons with the registered `iconify-icon` element:

```html
<button type="button" class="inline-flex items-center gap-2">
  <iconify-icon inline icon="lucide:download" aria-hidden="true"></iconify-icon>
  Download
</button>
```

The scripts and Iconify API requests require browser network access. Configure
the hosting content security policy with `script-src` access to jsDelivr,
`connect-src` access to the configured Iconify API, and `style-src` permission
for the inline `<style>` element generated by UnoCSS. The style rule typically
requires `'unsafe-inline'`. Use precompiled project CSS when the hosting policy
permits only nonce or hash styles. Update the pinned URL and its integrity hash
together when changing either dependency.

Use these small defaults before adding another styling or icon dependency:

- Compose ordinary layout, spacing, responsive behavior, typography, borders,
  and states with UnoCSS utilities in the HTML.
- Keep authored CSS for the view's tokens, projection variables, complex
  selectors, data visualizations, keyframes, and print behavior.
- Use Iconify for interface icons. Keep repeated SVG markup and decorative
  Unicode characters out of controls. Keep a visible label or an accessible
  name on interactive controls.

Aim for a short stylesheet whose remaining rules express the view's own visual
system. Avoid copying utility-equivalent declarations into large selector
blocks.

Import browser-ready ESM modules at the top of the module script. Prefer a
versioned URL for maintained project source:

```js
import * as d3 from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@7/+esm";
```

Choose the URL form that matches the dependency source:

- Latest npm release for deliberate experiments:
  `import * as d3 from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3/+esm";`
- Versioned npm package:
  `import * as d3 from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@7/+esm";`
- Concise statistical charts:
  `import * as Plot from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/plot@0.6/+esm";`
- Tabular transformation:
  `import * as aq from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/arquero@8/+esm";`
- Modular charting from an exported package subpath:
  `import * as echarts from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/echarts@6/core/+esm";`
- CSV parsing from JSR through esm.sh:
  `import { parse as parseCsv } from "https://esm.sh/jsr/@std/csv";`

Remote modules require browser network access and a hosting content security
policy that allows the selected CDN. Keep all dependency origins explicit and
prefer versioned imports when the same source must rebuild consistently.

## Work within the HTML project

- Keep the document structure and projection hosts in `index.html`.
- Keep styles and browser behavior inline for a compact page, or reference CSS
  through `<link rel="stylesheet">` and JavaScript through `<script src>`
  directly from `index.html`. Studio copies these exact `.css`, `.js`, and
  `.mjs` source files into the browser artifact.
- Keep each direct source as a leaf file. Bundle or inline local CSS `url()` and
  `@import` dependencies and local JavaScript imports or re-exports. Explicit
  HTTPS, data, and fragment references remain available.
- Leave `<base href>` out of the entry document. HTTP and HTTPS dependency URLs
  need `//` and a host.
- Choose a provider that builds the JavaScript module graph for import maps,
  computed imports, and source-phase imports.
- Keep direct JavaScript within the pinned parser's accepted grammar. Inspection
  fails closed when it cannot establish the dependency boundary.
- End `break` and `continue` with `;` when another statement follows. The pinned
  grammar rejects a following regex statement when automatic semicolon
  insertion separates it from the restricted statement.
- The pinned grammar rejects import attributes on re-export statements. Import
  the remote module with its attributes, then use
  `export { value as default }` to preserve a default re-export. Enumerate named
  exports or choose a graph-building provider for a wildcard re-export.
- Keep projection hosts inside `#app-shell`.
- Inline project-owned images and fonts with the document. External HTTP URLs
  and `data:` URLs remain available.
- Use browser APIs for focused interaction. Choose the React or Svelte starter
  when the page needs component compilation, a local import graph, or separate
  browser assets.

Studio publishes the entry document and its declared local sources after
validating the HTML and projection hosts. Treat the built artifact as the
acceptance boundary for the page.

## Link custom results to notebook inputs

Keep projection hosts explicit in authored source. Custom regions need every
kernel input, a readable label, and a rendering-source reference such as
`{"path":"index.html"}`. Keep these attributes on authored elements outside
native output subtrees. Follow the installed Studio skill's
`references/projections.md` for the shared contract:

```python
import marimo_studio

print(marimo_studio.agent.skill().file("references/projections.md").read_text())
```

## Maintain project ignore rules

You own this view project's `.gitignore`. When adding libraries, extensions, or
build tools, ignore their generated files, caches, local configuration, and
secrets. Keep authored source, dependency manifests, and lockfiles tracked.
Studio supplies workspace rules for its own artifacts and locks. Check
`git status --short --ignored` after running new tooling and update the view's
ignore rules before committing.
